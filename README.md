# Microscopic-Ghost-Imaging-with-Latent-Diffusion

Microscopic ghost imaging(MGI), as an emerging technology, effectively breaks through the limitations of traditional imaging methods. In particular, its integration with deep learning has demonstrated immense potential in enhancing both imaging speed and quality. However, the scarcity of data poses a significant challenge, as the limited datasets impede the training of downstream task models, thereby restricting the methodâ€™s practical applicability. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach for MGI generation based on latent diffusion models. The aim is to generate high-quality red blood cell images and corresponding one-dimensional light intensity signals to enrich the training data for downstream tasks. By designing a random mask generation method and integrating the physical mechanisms of MGI with deep learning models, we successfully generated a large volume of synthetic data pairs, thereby expanding the training dataset. This strategy effectively enhances the image reconstruction quality of MGI. Experimental results demonstrate that, at the same imaging speed, deep learning models incorporating the generated data show significant improvements. These models not only enhance the accuracy of image reconstruction but also bring out finer details, validating the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method in the field of MGI. The dataset and code will be released after the publication of the paper to support further research.
